# User Acceptance Testing Plan

## Test Scenarios

### 1. User Registration and Login
- Register a new user account
- Log in with the newly created account
- Attempt to log in with incorrect credentials

### 2. Dashboard Functionality
- Access the dashboard after login
- Verify all dashboard components are loading correctly
- Test any interactive elements on the dashboard

### 3. Agent Zero Functionality
- Create a new Agent Zero instance
- Configure Agent Zero parameters
- Run a simulation with Agent Zero
- View and interpret results

### 4. Data Visualization
- Generate various types of charts and graphs
- Verify data accuracy in visualizations
- Test interactive features of visualizations

### 5. Collaborative Intelligence
- Set up a collaborative task
- Add multiple agents to the task
- Run the collaborative simulation
- Analyze the results of the collaboration

### 6. Performance Prediction
- Input data for performance prediction
- Run the prediction model
- Verify the accuracy and presentation of predictions

### 7. Admin Panel (if applicable)
- Log in as an admin user
- Access and navigate the admin panel
- Perform administrative tasks (e.g., user management, system configuration)

### 8. Security and Privacy
- Attempt to access restricted areas without proper authentication
- Verify that sensitive data is properly protected
- Test password reset functionality

### 9. Responsiveness and UI
- Test the application on different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Verify that the UI is consistent and functional across devices

### 10. Error Handling
- Intentionally cause errors (e.g., invalid input, network disconnection)
- Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed
- Check that the system recovers gracefully from errors

## Test Execution

1. For each scenario, create detailed test cases with step-by-step instructions.
2. Assign each test case to a specific tester or user group.
3. Provide a method for testers to report issues and feedback (e.g., a shared document or issue tracking system).
4. Set a timeline for the UAT process, including a deadline for feedback.
5. Review and prioritize reported issues for resolution before final deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- All critical functionality works as expected
- No high-priority bugs are present
- The system meets performance requirements under expected load
- User interface is intuitive and meets design specifications
- All security measures are in place and effective

## Post-UAT Actions

- Compile a report of all issues found during UAT
- Prioritize and address critical issues
- Conduct a final review meeting with stakeholders
- Obtain sign-off from key stakeholders before proceeding to production deployment
